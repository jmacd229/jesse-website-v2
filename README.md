# Jesse's Website (Re-design)

This repo is the start of a redesigned version of https://github.com/jmacd229/jesse-website.

## Why start from scratch?

The original website I created very early into my career as an experiment to see if I could teach myself React. It served an excellent purpose in doing so but it also contains many mistakes that would only slow me down to undo.

Some things I'm hoping to achieve with this redesign
- A proper re-usable design system, separate from the website
- Minimal 3rd-party library usage
- Clean concise coding practices
