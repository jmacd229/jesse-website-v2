      At Canada Life (formerly London Life), I evolved from an intern on a
      legacy support team into a key full-stack contributor on multiple Agile
      teams.
      <ExperienceDetailsDescriptionHeading icon="Bug">
        Production Support
      </ExperienceDetailsDescriptionHeading>
      Supported critical production systems written in ASP.NET, VB.NET, and C#.
      Served in a 24/7 on-call rotation, debugging legacy Windows/Unix systems
      and C programsâ€”gaining early experience in high-pressure, low-support
      environments.
      <ExperienceDetailsDescriptionHeading icon="Work">
        Full-stack Development
      </ExperienceDetailsDescriptionHeading>
      Chosen as one of five developers to reimagine the member experience site I
      previously supported. Transitioned into full-stack development using
      Angular, Java Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and MongoDB.
      <ExperienceDetailsDescriptionHeading icon="Accessibility">
        Accessibility
      </ExperienceDetailsDescriptionHeading>
      Acted as a primary contributor toward meeting WCAG 2.0 AA compliance,
      working closely with accessibility specialists and embedding a11y best
      practices across the UI.
